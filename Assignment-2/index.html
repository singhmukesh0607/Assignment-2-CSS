                            <p>While football has been played for centuries, its beginnings were quite different from the beautiful game you might see today.
                                For starters, the balls didn’t begin round and they weren’t made of rubber either. Instead a pig’s bladder was blown up and encased in leather, which made it more egg shaped in appearance. The ball was lighter than they are today, but became heavier in wet conditions because of high absorbency!!! <a href="https://footballfestivals.co.uk/blog/brief-history-football/"> Read More </a></p>

                            <p>The origins of cricket lie somewhere in the Dark Ages - probably after the Roman Empire, almost certainly before the Normans invaded England, and almost certainly somewhere in Northern Europe. All research concedes that the game derived from a very old, widespread and uncomplicated pastime by which one player served up an object, be it a small piece of wood or a ball, and another hit it with a suitably fashioned club... <a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22771053/a-brief-history-cricket"> Read More </a></p>
